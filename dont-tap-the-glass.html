    <h1>Don't Tap the Glass Review — Tyler, The Creator’s New Project Is a Genre-Hopping Nostalgia Trip</h1>

  <main>
    <p>Right from the jump, Tyler throws us into unfamiliar waters. The opener, <em>"Big Poe"</em>, hits with a sound I can’t quite place — not instantly recognizable in the usual “Tyler, The Creator” way, besides his signature head-loving bars. It’s disorienting, a little jagged, maybe even intentional. But it sets a tone: this is going to be different.</p>

    <p>Then comes <em>“Sugar On My Tongue”</em>, and suddenly we’re back on solid ground — or rather, floating somewhere between now and the early 2000s. It’s a radio-ready dance-pop track straight out of a time capsule, with hints of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland-era production. Those sirens, the voicebox — it all hits that nostalgia nerve we didn’t realize we were missing. It’s catchy without being hollow, sugary without rotting your teeth.</p>

    <p><em>“Sucka Free”</em> dives even deeper into the past, this time channeling '90s R&B. It’s sexed-up, slow-tempo, mood-lit — but crucially, it carries over that same voicebox motif, making the transition between tracks feel intentional and seamless.</p>

    <p>Then comes <em>“Mommanem.”</em> The nursery rhyme-esque melody is a total gear shift — almost jarring — and for the first time, it feels like the album’s grip loosens. The track lands dangerously close to some of the AI-generated “leaks” that surfaced before the album dropped. Whether that’s coincidence or a wink at the discourse, it’s hard to say — but it’s undeniably a moment of whiplash after the two incredible tracks that precede it.</p>

    <p><em>“Stop Playing With Me”</em> gets us back on course with more retro flavors: clap samples, dog barks, and an undercurrent of 2017 SoundCloud energy. The track blends two eras of nostalgia — early 2000s ringtone rap and the lo-fi blow-up scene — and makes them dance together in the same room.</p>

    <p>Then <em>“Ring Ring Ring”</em> slides in like velvet. A silky, funky bassline lays the foundation while disco-tinged orchestration brings in echoes of MJ. It’s easily one of the sexiest tracks Tyler’s ever made, reminiscent of “Sucka Free” but turned up to eleven. There’s even a hypnagogic shimmer to the track, like it’s been plucked from a dream of the past.</p>

    <p>The near-titular track <em>"Don't Tap That Glass / Tweakin'"</em> feels like the kind of song you’d blast while cruising in that convertible from the promo imagery. Think Ghost Town DJs’ <em>“My Boo,”</em> but modernized — still 90s R&B to its core, but sharper, louder, and built for today’s speakers.</p>

    <p><em>“I’ll Take Care of You”</em> is maybe the closest thing to <strong>IGOR</strong> we’ve heard from Tyler since that era ended — a gentle, emotional return to form that also manages to pull in many of the sonic threads we’ve been hearing throughout the record. It feels like a true resolution, a moment where all the chaos softens and makes sense.</p>

    <p>And finally, <em>“Tell Me What It Is”</em> plays like the perfect end credits. It’s light, upbeat, and adventurous — a curtain call on a journey that’s taken us through decades of genre, feeling, and influence.</p>

    <p>Aside from the misstep that is <em>“Mommanem”</em> and an opener that doesn’t quite keep pace with the record’s strongest moments, this project is tight, exciting, and arguably the most fun Tyler has sounded in years. It’s bold, messy in the best way, and unafraid to play. I’ll be spinning this one a lot in the weeks ahead — and if you’re like me, you will too.</p>

    <p><strong>Score:</strong> 8.6 / 10</p>
