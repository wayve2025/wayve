  <main>
    <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the pioneering frontman of Black Sabbath and heavy metal’s most enduring icon, has passed away at the age of 76. His family announced the news in a heartfelt statement saying, “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.”</p>

    <h2>Final Performance</h2>
    <p>Osbourne’s final days were marked by his farewell performance at Birmingham’s Villa Park on July 5. Seated on a throne due to mobility limitations from Parkinson’s disease, he closed Black Sabbath’s <em>Back to the Beginning</em> charity concert — a poignant reunion with original bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward.</p>

    <h2>Health Battles</h2>
    <p>Despite battling a rare Parkin‑2 variant of Parkinson’s disease diagnosed in the early 2000s, and ongoing complications from a severe ATV accident and multiple surgeries, Osbourne continued his career with passion. He remained candid about his health struggles while embracing his role as a genre-defining figure.</p>

    <h2>Legacy & Tributes</h2>
    <p>Osbourne’s massive influence transcended decades. As the <strong>Prince of Darkness</strong>, he helped shape heavy metal with songs like “<em>Paranoid</em>,” “<em>Iron Man</em>,” and “<em>War Pigs</em>” during his time with Black Sabbath, and achieved solo success with hits such as “<em>Crazy Train</em>” and “<em>No More Tears</em>.” He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice — once with Black Sabbath and once as a solo artist.</p>

    <p>Tributes have poured in from bandmates and music icons alike. Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler paid emotional tributes to their longtime collaborator, while artists such as Elton John and Rod Stewart honored Osbourne’s groundbreaking impact.</p>

    <h2>Family, Funeral & Public Farewell</h2>
    <p>Ozzy is survived by his wife <strong>Sharon Osbourne</strong>—married to him for 43 years—and their three children: Kelly, Jack, and Aimee, along with three children from his first marriage: Louis, Jessica, and Elliot.</p>

    <p>A public procession in Birmingham took place, with thousands of fans paying tribute at landmarks like the <strong>Black Sabbath Bridge</strong>. His private funeral ceremony was held in Buckinghamshire on July 30, attended by close family and industry figures, including members of Metallica, Slipknot, and Marilyn Manson.</p>

    <p>Sharon was described as “heartbroken,” surrounded by her children helping her through grief during this painful period.</p>

    <h2>Farewell Words & Final Moments</h2>
    <p>Longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde revealed the final text message he received from Ozzy shortly after the farewell show: <em>“I love you, buddy.”</em> The message underscores their decades-long bond as both professional collaborators and close friends.</p>

    <h2>Closing the Chapter on a Legend</h2>
    <p>Ozzy Osbourne’s death marks the end of an era. From forging heavy metal with Black Sabbath to redefining rock culture on his own, he was a force of nature — unapologetic, theatrical, and endlessly influential. His legacy lives on in the thousands of artists he inspired, the genre he helped create, and the fans who still chant his name.</p>

    <p>Ozzy Osbourne’s passing is not only the loss of a rock titan, but the closing of a legacy that shaped heavy metal and pop culture alike. His impact will resonate for generations.</p>
